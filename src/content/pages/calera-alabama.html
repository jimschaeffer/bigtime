        <li>Edging along driveways, sidewalks, and landscape beds</li>

        <li>Leaf removal and seasonal cleanups to keep your yard neat</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Sod Installation in Calera</h4>
      <p>
        A patchy, uneven lawn can detract from your home’s curb appeal. Our sod
        installation services provide an instant solution, giving you a lush,
        green lawn in just a few weeks. We help you select the best sod variety
        for Calera’s climate and soil conditions, ensuring long-lasting results.
        Our process includes soil preparation, sod installation, and
        post-installation care instructions to help your new lawn establish
        strong roots.
      </p>

      <h4>Mulch & Pinestraw Installation</h4>
      <p>
        Adding mulch or pinestraw to your landscape beds enhances the overall
        look of your property while improving plant health. Our team applies
        high-quality mulch to help retain moisture, regulate soil temperature,
        and prevent weed growth. Whether you prefer a natural pinestraw covering
        or decorative mulch in various colors, we tailor our installation to
        complement your landscape design.
      </p>

      <h4>Landscape Lighting Installation</h4>
      <p>
        Outdoor lighting enhances your home’s aesthetics, improves safety, and
        increases functionality for outdoor entertaining. We design and install
        landscape lighting systems to highlight architectural features, trees,
        walkways, and garden beds. Our professional lighting solutions help
        homeowners in Calera create an inviting atmosphere while improving
        nighttime visibility and security.
      </p>

      <h4>Drainage & Grading Solutions</h4>

        Poor drainage can cause standing water, erosion, and damage to your
        landscape. Our team offers grading and drainage solutions to improve
        water flow and prevent lawn damage. We install French drains, dry creek
        beds, and custom grading adjustments to ensure your yard remains free
        from excess moisture and water-related issues.
      </p>

      <h4>Gutter Cleaning & Pressure Washing</h4>
      <p>
        Keeping your home’s exterior clean is just as important as maintaining
        the lawn. Our pressure washing services remove dirt, grime, and mildew
        from driveways, patios, and sidewalks, restoring them to their original
        condition. We also offer professional gutter cleaning to prevent clogs
