        weeds. Our Chelsea lawn maintenance program includes:
      </p>

          polished look

          Leaf removal and seasonal cleanups to keep your yard looking neat
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Sod Installation in Chelsea</h4>
      <p>
        A lush, green lawn can be achieved instantly with sod installation. Our
        professional sod services provide an effective solution for homeowners
        looking to replace patchy, unhealthy grass. We handle everything from
        soil preparation to sod selection and installation, ensuring your new
        lawn thrives in Chelsea’s climate.
      </p>

      <h4>Mulch & Pinestraw Installation</h4>
      <p>
        Applying fresh mulch or pinestraw improves soil health while enhancing
        the appearance of your landscaping. Our mulch and pinestraw services
        help retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. We
        offer various mulch options to match the aesthetics of your home.
      </p>

      <h4>Landscape Lighting Installation</h4>
      <p>
        Outdoor lighting enhances your home’s aesthetics and improves safety.

        beauty of your outdoor space while increasing nighttime visibility.
      </p>

      <h4>Drainage & Grading Solutions</h4>
      <p>
        Poor drainage can lead to standing water, erosion, and lawn damage. Our
        grading and drainage solutions prevent water-related issues by improving
        runoff and redirecting excess moisture. We install French drains, dry
        creek beds, and custom grading adjustments to protect your property from
        water damage.
      </p>

      <h4>Gutter Cleaning & Pressure Washing</h4>
      <p>
        Maintaining your home’s exterior is just as important as caring for your
        lawn. Our gutter cleaning services prevent blockages and water buildup,
        while our pressure washing services remove dirt, stains, and grime from
        sidewalks, patios, and driveways, restoring them to their original
        condition.
